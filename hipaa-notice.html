        <h1>Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>
        
        <div class="effective-notice">
            <h2>Effective Date: September 23, 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Pledge Regarding Medical Information</h2>
        <p>We understand that medical information about you and your health is personal. We are committed to protecting medical information about you. We create a record of the care and services you receive at our practice. We need this record to provide you with quality care and to comply with certain legal requirements. This notice applies to all of the records of your care generated by this practice.</p>

        <p>This notice will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose medical information about you. We also describe your rights and certain obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of medical information.</p>

        <p>We are required by law to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that medical information that identifies you is kept private</li>
            <li>Give you this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you</li>
            <li>Follow the terms of the notice that is currently in effect</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We May Use and Disclose Medical Information About You</h2>
        
        <h3>For Treatment</h3>
        <p>We may use medical information about you to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, or other personnel who are involved in taking care of you.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Different departments of our practice may share medical information about you in order to coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work, and X-rays. We may also disclose medical information about you to people outside our practice who may be involved in your medical care after you leave our practice, such as family members, clergy, or others we use to provide services that are part of your care.</p>

        <h3>For Payment</h3>
        <p>We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services you receive may be billed to and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company, or a third party.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> We may need to give your health plan information about surgery you received so your health plan will pay us or reimburse you for the surgery. We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.</p>

        <h3>For Health Care Operations</h3>
        <p>We may use and disclose medical information about you for our health care operations. These uses and disclosures are necessary to run our practice and make sure that all of our patients receive quality care.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> We may use medical information to review our treatment and services and to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you. We may also combine medical information about many patients to decide what additional services we should offer, what services are not needed, and whether certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, and other personnel for review and learning purposes.</p>

        <h2>Special Situations</h2>
        
        <h3>Appointment Reminders</h3>
        <p>We may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care.</p>

        <h3>Treatment Alternatives</h3>
        <p>We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.</p>

        <h3>Health-Related Benefits and Services</h3>
        <p>We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you.</p>

        <h3>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care</h3>
        <p>We may release medical information about you to a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. We may also tell your family or friends your condition and that you are in the hospital. In addition, we may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status, and location.</p>

        <h2>Uses and Disclosures That Require Your Authorization</h2>
        
        <div class="important-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We will not use or disclose your medical information for any purpose other than those identified in the previous sections without your specific, written authorization.
